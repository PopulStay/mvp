story-product__description1=The biggest challenge and hidden danger of smart locks is security.
story-product__description2=For the hardware part, the cylinder in the lock allows the locksmith or thieve to open the door lock easily, it is just a matter of time, depending on the grade of the cylinder. For the software part, a central door lock management system means that once the server is hacked, hackers will acquire the control rights of all the door locks at zero cost. This would be a catastrophic event.
story-product__description3=PopulStay, however, developed the world's first genuine, keyless, blockchain-based smart lock and its associated chips.The door locks are managed through a smart contract. The owner of the door lock can determine, who can use the door lock and access the property during which period, and the user of the door lock needs to confirm the transaction of the door lock with a smart phone and gets authenticated first.
story-product__description4=In our scenario, the door lock will deduct the rental fee from the frozen PPS token and return the balance to the user after usage. The rental fee will be transferred to the host automatically. The process completely eliminates the need of a third party.Those smart door locks and smart key boxes for e.g. houses, cars, washing machines, bikes and anything else that can be locked, allow to bring extra income to individuals or businesses.
story-product__description5=We are convinced that smart locks will revolutionize the sharing economy and even become the infrastructure for the future economy.
